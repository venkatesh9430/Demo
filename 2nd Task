1) Install

i)Apache2

ii)MySQL

iii)Docker

2.Pulls a Docker image

3.Runs the container with ephemeral storage (e.g., mounted to /mnt/ephemeral)


--> vi config.yml

i.e.

--> Ansible installed in the source machine
--> we need to define the inventory.ini file
i.e.

[webservers]
10.0.0.119(server private ip) ansible_user=ubuntu   ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_ed25519(private kery)

Note: 

1st we need to generate ssh-keygen
i) Add your new public key to authorized_keys
   i.e.
        cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
--> Run the playbook
i.e. 
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini config.yml
